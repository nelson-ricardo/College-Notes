# Heaps (Priority Queue)

Biased queue. 
operations:
1. Add - Enqueue give the priority of the thing
2.  Remove - Dequeue the highest priority value
3. Front - get the value with the highest priority

ADT -  different implementations
1. Linked List (Highest priority head) need a sorted linked list
	1. Insertion = AVG O(N)
2. BST
	1. Insertion = AVG O(log(N))
	2. Front = AVG O(log(N))
3. AVL
	1. Insertion = AVG O(log(N))
	2. Remove = AVG O(log(N))
	3. Front = AVG O(log(N))
4. Heap, a tree that is sorted from top to bottom

The Heap is structured so every node is the highest priority of its subtree. 

## Complete Binary Heap
Each row needs to be complete before moving to the next **and** the last row is filled from left to right. 

## AVL Runtime
Insert
- Best O(log(N))
- Avg O(log(N))
- Worst O(log(N))
Contains
- Best O(1)
- Avg O(log(N))
- Worst O(log(N))
Removes
- Best O(log(N))
- Avg O(log(N))
- Worst O(log(N))
