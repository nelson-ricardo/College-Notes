Suppose we have a has table of size 10
Consider the following values inserted using double hasing.

| Name   | Hash1 | Hash2 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Alice  | 3     | 6     |
| Bob    | 1     | 5     |
| Carol  | 4     | 3     |
| David  | 1     | 5     |
| Eric   | 5     | 8     |
| Fred   | 9     | 9     |
| George | 2     | 7     |
|        |       |       |
Who would be the first value that collides twice? (if any)


| Indices | 0   | 1   | 2      | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6   | 7   | 8    | 9    |
| ------- | --- | --- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
|         |     | Bob | George | Alice | Carol | David |     |     | Eric | Fred |
2 collisions with eric and david. no collisions twice. 

## Linear Probing
If index is taken, index that is to the right until an empty slot is found
## Quadratic Probing
Try: $Index+Collisions^{\text{collisions}}$
Use $mod$ to wrap around the array if we go out of bounds


| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Value | A   | B   |     |     | C   | F   | E   |     |     | D   |
Insert 10 values that hash to 0.
Insert A at 0
Try insert B at 0, cannot, go to 1
Try insert C at 0, cannot, go to 4 (2^2)

**Use the total amount of collisions and square it and modulo (sizeof(array))**


| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Value | A   | B   |     | C   |     |     |     |     |     | D   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
**Ideal to use prime numbers (any for this insertion type)** 

Simple program to find primes and the number of quadratic probing we can do
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int isPrime(int x) {
	for(int factor = 2; factor * factor <= x; factor++) {
		if(x % factor == 0) {
			return 0;
		}
	}
	return 1;
}

// determine how many insertion can happen at the same location, before
// a insertion is no longer possible
int testQuad(int size) {
	int empty[size];
	// the array is empty at first
	for(int i = 0; i < sizeo; i++) {
		empty[i] = 0;
	}

	int ans = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		int index = (i * i) % size;
		// int index = ((scale * (i * i)) % size + size)% size;
		// scale *= -1
		if(empty[index]) {
			ans++;
			empty[index]++;
		}
	}
	return ans;
}

int main(void) {
	for(int i = 2; i < 100; i++) {
		if(isPrime(i)) {
			printf("%d can insert %d values at the same hash.\n", testQuad(i));
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**If the array of the hash table is about half full then we double the size of the array**

\[NOT ON FE\]
`index + collisions^2 * (-1)^collisions`
Size prime and 3 (mode 4) for 100% utilization

Quadratic probing is useful when many values are clustered together. Reduce the # of collisions by a factor of 3. Not theoretically significant in terms of approximation. 

### Analysis
What is the runtime of linear/quadratic probing?

| Best          | Avg                            | Worst                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| $\theta(1)$   | $\theta(1)$                    | $\theta(N)$             |
| no collisions | Assume a well distributed hash | collide with everything |
The average is hard to analyze without knowing how full/empty the array is. 
**"Fullness" of the array is required to compute this.** 

Assume the array is half full (upper bound)
$$
\displaylines{
A = (\frac{1}{2}(1\text{operation} + A\text{probe for new location})) (\frac{1}{2}(1))
\newline\text{first parenthesis is a collision, second is no collision}

\frac{1}{2}A=1\\
A=2
}
$$

**Deletion sucks in probing**


| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|       | A   | B   | C   | D   |     |
All values should have been in the 0 index

Remove

| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|       | A   |     | C   | D   |     |
Look for C, C is not in table! We do not remove it, just mark it for removal, it used to be there but not anymore. 

## Chaining
Chaining avoids these gaps in the sequence.
Chaining stores all values with a particular hash at that index in some collection. *linked list*

Array of linked list pointers

Removal is easy because we can cut a link and live with our days. 


| Best        | Avg         | Woest       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $\theta(1)$ | $\theta(1)$ | $\theta(N)$ |
