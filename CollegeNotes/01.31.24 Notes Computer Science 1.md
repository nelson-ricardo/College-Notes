## Stacks
- The bottom value is always the oldest. 
- The newest plate is always going to be the one at the top. 
- The Top is the value modified when inserting and removing. 

Applications of the stack
- Undo feature of document editors
- The program stack 

**Last In, First Out**

### Implementation
- ArrayList
- LinkedList

#### ArrayList
- Append adds values into the ArrayList (push something on top of the stack)
- To remove the value we free the memory and decrease the size of the ArrayList (pop a value on top of the stack)
	- just size decrementing also works to remove values on the stack
- Access at index `[size - 1]` which is the top value of the stack

#### Linked List
- The top could be the `HEAD` or `TAIL` 
- `HEAD`
	- push values we just insert the head 
	- pop values we just remove the head
- `TAIL`
	- push values we just Insert Tail
	- pop values we just Remove tail

## Expression Parsing

`3 + (4 + 1 * 3) * 2` It has infix expressions -> (math operators) in between operands

We use postfix expression (reverse polish notation) have operators after the operands
**Note: operators immediately follow operands and are executed in order of appearance left to right** (first operation we see, first one we perform)

Infix: 3 \* 2 + 1
Postfix: 3 2 \* 1 + 

Infix: 4 + 2 \* 3
Postfix: 4 2 3 \* +

- 2 steps for evaluating infix
	1. Convert to postfix first
	2. Evaluate postfix
		1. Every time we see an operator, fetch the last 2 operands (from the stack) and operate on them

```Loop through expression:
	if operand:
		push(operand to stack)
	if operator
		operand 1 = top and pop
		operand 2 = top and pop
		push(operand2 operate with operand1)
	return top of the stack
```
