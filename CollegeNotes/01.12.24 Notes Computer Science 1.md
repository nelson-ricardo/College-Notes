Continuation of [[01.10.24 Notes Computer Science 1]] of `strcmp` 
`strcmp` uses lexicographical comparison and uses ASCII. 
`strcmp(const char* str1, const char* str2)`
Possible outputs:
- 0 - which is equal to the first null terminator
- > 0 (greater than 0) - 1st different character s1\[char] > s2\[char]
- < 0 (less than 0) - 1st different character s1\[char] < s2\[char]

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Memory is divided into three systems

- The stack 
	- hardcoded values in our code. 
	- Tightly packed 
	- Cannot change the size of the allocation
	- Stack allocation size are also limited
- The heap
	- Spread out memory
	- Ability to resize
	- Able to allocate large memory blocks without restriction
	- heap also allows allocations within functions
- Static memory

Functions to use the heap memory: 
- malloc - creates memory
- calloc - creates memory
- realloc - creates and delete memory
- free - deletes memory

### Malloc
Take in as a parameter # of bytes to allocate (size_t)
**If it fails it returns NULL** 
**If successful it returns a void* , it is highly recommended to cast it to the desired pointer** 

When using malloc, the values stored in the memory is G A R B A G E. **Rule of Thumb: initialize malloc memory manually** 

Trivia: **free(NULL) is a safe operation** 

Freeing the same variable twice will fuck up the memory manager. 
Trying to access a variable after freeing the memory will have **undefined behavior** 
```c
int *arr = (int*) malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // allocate memory

free(arr); // free the memory

//arr = NULL (very good thing)

arr[0] = 0; // use after free, REALLY ASS THING UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
```
